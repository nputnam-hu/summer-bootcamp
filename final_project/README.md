## Final Project
### Purpose
Use advanced **machine learning** algorithms, through the nltk library to find an application of sentiment analysis
### Resources
[Intro to nltk/python](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html)
### How to use this directory
We have two example projects provided for you:
- Spam filter, that uses the NLTK bayesian classifier to build a spam detection bot and the gmail API to classify your own mail as spam or not spam
- SECOND TBD, poss. chatbot?

Each project dir has an example folder which is an implementation that we have already done and a skeleton folder which should be distributed to students interested in building their own implementation of the project.  


Students are not limited to just these 2 projects, and are welcome to pursue one of their own invention (though they should be approved by the course instructor to ensure viability in the alloted 3-day window).  Students pursuing custom projects are welcome to look at the source code we have provided in this repo for inspiration, but should be sure to not directly copy it and instead do their own original work.

Instructor should demo both of the example projects, and explain the outline for the final projects to the students
