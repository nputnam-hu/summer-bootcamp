# Summer Bootcamp Final Project: sentiment
CS50 provides a free online ciriculum that in many ways mirrors that of this bootcamp.  They have on their website a project that fits perfectly with the goals of the course, so we are going to offer it as an option for the final project.  In this project, you will use the twitter API to classify the sentiment of tweets in different ways.

## Problems
Complete tasks 1 and 2 [here](http://docs.cs50.net/problems/sentiments/sentiments.html).  The third task involves web development and is probably too complicated for the scope of this task.
