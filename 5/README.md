### Day 5 Hacktime
- There are folders with different example solutions of the various problems, look through them so that you can better help students who are struggling with them
- The skeletons directory will be the one students will get the zip for from google drive and unzip in their local directory
- bootcamp.py is a helper file that can be imported to use functions that are beyond the scope of the project.  Students should feel free to look into it if they want to see under the hood
- The class directory contains code you might want to show off during the lecture part of the class
